### Summary: 
The app displays recipes fetched from the provided API in a modern, visually appealing interface. Features include:

- Card-based UI with recipe images, names, and cuisine types
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states
- Custom image caching for efficient network usage
- Modern aesthetic with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations

### Focus Areas: 
Architecture and Code Quality

- Focused on creating a clean, maintainable codebase using MVVM architecture
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Created testable components with dependency injection


Performance

- Implemented custom image caching to minimize network usage
- Used async/await for modern concurrency handling
- Employed LazyVStack for efficient scrolling performance


User Experience

- Created an intuitive, single-screen interface
- Added visual feedback for loading and error states
- Designed a modern, visually appealing UI

### Time Spent:
Total time: Around 3.5 hours

Planning and setup: 20 minutes
Core functionality: 1.5 hours
UI implementation: 1 hour
Testing: 20 minutes

### Trade-offs and Decisions: 
- Chose ScrollView over List for better UI customization, trading some performance optimization for visual appeal
- Used SwiftUI's AsyncImage initially for rapid development, then implemented custom caching
- Focused on core functionality over additional features to ensure quality delivery of required elements

### Weakest Part of the Project: 
The image caching system could be more robust. While it works for the current requirements, it could benefit from:

- Cache size management
- Cache expiration policies
- Better error handling for edge cases
- More comprehensive testing

### Additional Information: 
- Implemented the project using iOS 16 as the minimum supported version to leverage modern SwiftUI features
- Used Swift's built-in frameworks exclusively as required
- Focused on making the code easily extensible for future feature additions
- Emphasized clean architecture principles while maintaining simplicity
